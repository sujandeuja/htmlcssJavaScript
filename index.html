 <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
 <p>
 "A man, a plan, a  programmer cafe". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted 
 in a damn good cup of Tea. programmers's  Cafe CEO is that man, and you already know his 
 plan: aprogrammers on every corner.
 <br/>
 In only a few years he's executed that plan and today
 you can enjoy coffee just about anywhere. And, of course, the big news this year 
 is that programmer teamed up with Head First readers to createprogrammers's Web presence, 
 which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of 
 customers.
